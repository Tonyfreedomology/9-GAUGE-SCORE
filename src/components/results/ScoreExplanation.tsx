          We've worked with over 11,000 people in the past 15 years and learned that <span className="font-bold italic">balance</span> is the key to building a beautiful life.
        </p>
        
        <p>
          Our culture pushes the hustle and grind mindset as the path to success, but we see it differently.
        </p>
        
        <p>
          Balance is a superpower, and hustle culture is a disease. When your finances, health, and relationships work in harmony, life becomes more free, fulfilling, and fun.

          So how did we arrive at your score?
        </p>
        
        <p>
          Each pillar gets a rating from 0 to 100, based on questions about key areas—like debt, investments, generosity, mental health, and your connection to the people around you.
        </p>
        
        <p>
          If certain areas slip below a healthy level (like generosity or mental well-being), your overall score gets capped. That's because true freedom is about more than just being personally successful—it's about building a life that helps you thrive and also uplifts the people around you.
        </p>
