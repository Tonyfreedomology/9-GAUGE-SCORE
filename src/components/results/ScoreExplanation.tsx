          Your <span className="font-bold">9-Gauge Score</span> isn't just a number—it's your <strong>report card for life</strong>. It actively measures YOUR <em>health</em> (physical + environmental + mental), <em>wealth</em> (income + independence, impact) and <em>happiness</em> (great relationships with others + Self + God). While the world preaches <em>nonstop hustle</em>, we've learned over <strong>15 years</strong> and <strong>7,000+ lives</strong> that <u>balance is the real superpower</u> (and hustle culture?? Well, that can be a disease). When your money, wellness, and connections align, everything feels <strong>freer, richer, and a heck of a lot more fun</strong>.

          So how did we arrive at your score?
        </h3>
        
        <p className="text-lg">
          Each pillar gets a <strong>rating from 0 to 100</strong>, based on things like <em>debt, investments, generosity, mental + physical health</em>, and your <em>vibe with those around you</em> (including <strong>YOU</strong>). If any <em>key area lags</em>—say, your mental well-being or generosity—your <strong>overall score gets capped</strong>. Together, let's <u>redefine what SUCCESS really means</u>!
