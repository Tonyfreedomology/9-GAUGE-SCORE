          Your <span className="font-bold">9-Gauge Score</span> isn't just a number—it's your report card for life. It actively measures YOUR health (physical + environmental + mental), wealth (income + independence, impact) and happiness (great relationships with others + Self + God). While the world preaches nonstop hustle, we've learned over 15 years and 11,000+ lives that balance is the real superpower (and hustle culture?? Well, that can be a disease). When your money, wellness, and connections align, everything feels freer, richer, and a heck of a lot more fun.

          Each pillar gets a rating from 0 to 100, based on things like debt, investments, generosity, mental + physical health, and your vibe with those around you (including YOU). If any key area lags—say, your mental well-being or generosity—your overall score gets capped. Together, let's redefine what SUCCESS really means!
