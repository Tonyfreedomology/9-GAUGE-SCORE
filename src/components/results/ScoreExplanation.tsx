          Your <span className="font-bold">9-Gauge Score</span> measures your well-being across Finance, Health (physical and mental), and Relationships.

        <p className="text-lg">
          Our culture pushes the <span className="font-bold">hustle and grind mindset</span> as the path to success, but we see it differently.

        <p className="text-lg">
          We've worked with over <span className="font-bold">11,000 people</span> in the past 15 years and learned that <span className="font-bold italic">balance</span> is the key to building a beautiful life.

        <p className="text-lg">
          Balance is a <span className="font-bold">superpower</span>, and hustle culture is a disease. When your finances, health, and relationships work in harmony, life becomes more free, fulfilling, and fun.

          So how did we arrive at your score?
        </h3>
        
        <p className="text-lg">
          Each pillar gets a rating from <span className="font-bold">0 to 100</span>, based on questions about key areas—like debt, investments, generosity, mental health, and your connection to the people around you.
        </p>
        
        <p className="text-lg">
          If certain areas slip below a healthy level (like generosity or mental well-being), your overall score gets capped. That's because true freedom is about more than just being personally successful—it's about building a life that helps you thrive and also uplifts the people around you.
